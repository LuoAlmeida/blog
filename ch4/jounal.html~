    <p>
      My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
      everything packed and ready to go.Because I'm on a Segway,
      I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>cell phone</li>
      <li>iPod</li>
      <li>digital camera</li>
      <li>and a protein bar</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Just the essentials.As
      lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles <br> begins with one
	Segway.</q>
